# CSY1020 – Python Programming Fundamentals

## Overview
This repository contains my completed submission for **CSY1020: Problem Solving and Programming**
at the **University of Northampton**.

The assignment demonstrates core Python programming skills developed during
**Weeks 1–6**, including problem solving, program design, implementation, testing,
and reflection.

## Assignment Structure
The project consists of **four independent Python programs**, each saved as a
separate file:

- `Task1.py` – Basic input, processing, validation, and looping
- `Task2.py` – Text analysis (word count, longest word, averages)
- `Task3.py` – Dictionary-based data storage, calculations, and file output
- `Task4.py` – Program decomposition using multiple functions
